## Curl Installation Formula

In a `bash` shell with installed `curl` execute the following one-line command
to download and install `tv`. The `curl` formula will create a folder `~/bin`
(if not exist) and install `tv` in this directory.

```
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluccino/tool-tv/master/bin/tv >~wd; ~wd -!
```

# Appendix

## If CURL Is Not Installed

On Debian and Ubuntu you can install `curl`as follows:

```
    sudo apt install curl
```
